# This second part of our hands-on demonstration will create triggers to automatically start a new build whenever we push a new commit to Cloud Source Repositories. The command-line format for creating a trigger is below. Keep in mind that as of this filming, `gcloud` commands for triggers are in beta, and you are unable to name the trigger via command line:

gcloud beta builds triggers create cloud-source-repositories \
--repo=build-demo \
--branch-pattern="^master$" \
--build-config=cloud_build/build-run/trigger-build.yaml
